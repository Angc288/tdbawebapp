            10. COOKIES POLICY - INFORMATION MIP COLLECTS FROM YOU

            A. WHAT IS A COOKIE?

            A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer or mobile phone (referred to here as a "device") browser from a website's computer and is stored on your device's hard drive. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other websites. Many websites do this whenever a user visits their website in order to track online traffic flows (statistics).

            On MiP cookies record information about your online preferences and allow us to tailor the websites to your interests.

            Users have the opportunity to set their devices to accept all cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time. The last of these means that certain personalised features cannot then be provided to that user and accordingly they may not be able to take full advantage of all of the website's features. Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.

            During the course of any visit to MiP, the pages you see, along with a cookie, are downloaded to your device. Many websites do this, because cookies enable website publishers to do useful things like find out whether the device (and probably its user) has visited the website before. This is done on a repeat visit by checking to see, and finding, the cookie left there on the last visit.

            B. HOW DOES MIP USE COOKIES?

            Information supplied by cookies can help us to analyse the profile of our visitors and help us to provide you with a better user experience. For example, if on a previous visit you went to our services pages, we might find this out from your cookie and highlight service information on your second and subsequent visits.

            C. THIRD PARTY COOKIES ON ADVISER-HUB PAGES

            Please note that during your visits to MiP you may notice some cookies that are not related to MiP. When you visit a page with content embedded from, for example, YouTube or Flickr, you may be presented with cookies from these websites. MiP does not control the dissemination of these cookies. You should check the third-party websites for more information about these.

            D. MIP COOKIES AND HOW TO REJECT COOKIES?

            A list of the main cookies that the MiP websites set (and what each is used for) together with ways to minimise the number of cookies you receive can be found on paragraph 11.

            11. HOW TO CONTROL AND DELETE COOKIES

            MiP will not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information about you. However, if you wish to restrict or block the cookies which are set by MiP, or indeed any other website, you can do this through your browser settings. The Help function within your browser should tell you how.

            Please be aware that restricting cookies may impact on the functionality of MiP.

            If you wish to view your cookie code, just click on a cookie to open it. You'll see a short string of text and numbers. The numbers are your identification card, which can only be seen by the server that gave you the cookie.

            11.1. THIRD PARTY COOKIES

As a result, when you visit a page with content embedded from, for example, YouTube or Flickr, you may be presented with cookies from these websites. Adviser-Hub does not control the dissemination of these cookies. You should check the third-party websites for more information about these.

            GOOGLE ANALYTICS

            MiP uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. Google Analytics sets a cookie in order to evaluate your use of website(s) and compile reports for us on website activity.

            The "__utma" Cookie

            This cookie is what's called a "persistent" cookie, as in, it never expires (technically, it does expire…in the year 2038). This cookie keeps track of the number of times a visitor has been to the site according to the cookie, when their first visit was, and when their last visit occurred.

            The "__utmb" and "__utmc" Cookies

            The B and C cookies work together to calculate how long a visit takes. __utmb takes a timestamp of the exact moment in time when a visitor enters a site, while __utmc takes a timestamp of the exact moment in time when a visitor leaves a site. __utmb expires at the end of the session. __utmc waits 30 minutes, and then it expires.

            The "__utmz" Cookie

            __utmz keeps track of where the visitor came from, what search engine they used, what link they clicked on, what keyword they used, and where they were in the world when they accessed a website. It expires in 15,768,000 seconds – or, in 6 months. This cookie is how Google Analytics knows to whom and to what source / medium / keyword to assign the credit for a Goal Conversion.
